# Theme
The Foundations of Applied Software Engineering for Games workshop (FaSE4Games’26) has for goal to share innovative research contributions in software-engineering methods that address the challenges currently facing game development (entertainment games, serious games, and gamified applications).

# Goals
FaSE4Games workshop will gather the community (game researchers, game developers, and educators) and provide a safe space to share contributions and discuss relevant topics to the challenges of game development.

# Topics
Such challenges include, but are not limited to:

- **Artificial intelligence for software engineering** applied to games.
- **Software engineering for artificial intelligence** in games.
- **Debugging and fault localization** applied to games.
- **Distributed and collaborative software engineering** for game development.
- **Empirical software engineering** applied to games.
- **Human and social aspects of software engineering** in game development.
- **Human-computer interaction** in games.
- **Mining software repositories** for game development insights.
- **Mobile game development**.
- **Model-driven engineering** applied to games.
- **Parallel, distributed, and concurrent systems** in games.
- **Performance engineering** for games.
- **Program analysis** for games.
- **Program comprehension** in game development.
- **Program repair** in games.
- **Programming languages** for game development.
- **Recommendation systems** in games.
